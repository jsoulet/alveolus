Front-end web developed with AngularJS


Project status
--------------
I am currently refactoring the entire project in order to create a more understandable workflow.

Objectives
----------
The goal is to upgrade some technologies used for the beta version (like Bootstrap) and include some new techno for building a better code (Grunt, RequireJS, SASS...)

After it my objective is to re-think the UI with a mobile first conception
